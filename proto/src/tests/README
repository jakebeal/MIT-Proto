Ordinarily, every test in this directory should always pass.
During the paleocompiler/neocompiler transition, however, the
some tests only pass with one version.

Paleocompiler passes all except the tests in:
  emitter.test
  emit-complex.test
  neocompiler.test

Neocompiler's current state:
  Running plugins.test  .  FAILED 4 out of 4 tests
  Running smoke.test  .  passed all 1 tests
